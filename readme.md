# 🏥 Hospital Inventory Management

## 🎯 What is this project?

This project helps hospital staff to:
- Track inventory levels of medical equipment and supplies in real-time.
- Easily identify items with low stock by highlighting inventory below reorder thresholds.
- Manage inventory expiration dates and receive reorder alerts (planned feature).
- Maintain accurate and up-to-date hospital inventory for efficient operations.

It demonstrates my skills in:  
✅ Backend development with Flask (or your backend of choice)  
✅ Frontend templating and static asset management  
✅ Inventory tracking logic and UI highlighting  
✅ Planning for scalable features like expiration and alerts  

## 🔧How it Works 
Inventory items with quantities below their reorder threshold are highlighted in red for easy identification.

You can view and manage inventory items via the web interface (add/update/remove features planned).
